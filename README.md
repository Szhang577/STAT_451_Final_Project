# The COVID-19 Face Mask Image Classification
The project aims to explore the applicable machine learning model for classifying whether individuals wear the mask appropriately, incorrectly, or did not wear it at all. To process, we download 4559 raw images from Kaggle. We processed the image data set into two representation ways, the raw pixel representation and color representation.  70\% of each data set is used for training, while the remaining 30\% is used for testing. 20\% of the training set in each data set is accounted for validation. We selected K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Bagging (with Decision Tree), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression algorithms to train and test. The tuning strategy is used in each algorithm to improve the test accuracy. In addition, We evaluate the model prediction outcome by the F1 Score and McNemar's Test. Consequently, we find that the XGBoost, with a test accuracy of 94.88\%, is the best machine learning model for this project.

Here is the visualized summary about the performances for each models we trained. We have evaluated both accuracy score and F1 score. The entire data set is split to 70% training and 30 % testing. The 20% of training set is used for validation. ![Accuracy vs  F1 Score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44512502/144944432-035e0a8d-73f8-43e5-b547-03307946b595.png)
